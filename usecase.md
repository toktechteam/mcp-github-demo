# DevOps Way Understanding MCP Servers and Use Case

## 1. What is an MCP Server?
An **MCP (Model Context Protocol) server** is a small, focused service that fetches context data for AI agents or LLMs.  
Instead of embedding multiple integrations directly into the AI agent, MCP servers abstract these integrations.

## 2. Real-World Use Cases
- Fetching Jira issues for ticket analysis by AI agents.
- Getting stock prices from Y-Finance for automated financial reporting.
- Fetching GitHub repositories for code analysis bots.
- In future: Slack messages, Confluence pages, CRM data, etc.

## 3. MCP vs Traditional Microservices (Layman Example)
**Microservices** are like Flipkart features:
- **Cart Service** holds your items.
- **Search Service** finds products.
- **Payment Service** handles payments.

**MCP Servers** are like small bots focused on **context** for AI:
- **MCP-Jira** fetches Jira issues.
- **MCP-GitHub** fetches repositories.
- **MCP-YFinance** fetches stock data.

Both break big problems into smaller parts, but MCP servers target **AI context delivery** rather than end-user-facing features.

---

## 4. Why AI Agents Need MCP Servers
- AI agents are designed to answer questions or perform tasks.
- They don’t natively know how to call Jira, GitHub, or financial APIs.
- MCP servers act as **data bridges**: fetch from external systems → format → return to AI agents.
- This keeps AI agents lightweight and secure.

---

## 5. How MCP Servers Connect & Send Responses
- AI Agent calls MCP endpoint (e.g., `/github`).
- MCP server fetches data (GitHub REST API).
- Response returned in structured JSON.
- AI agent uses that context to make decisions, summaries, or automation.

---

## 6. Our Demo Use Case
We built an **MCP-GitHub server**:
- Fetches a user’s public GitHub repos from GitHub API.
- Exposes them at `/github?user=username`.
- AI agents (or any client) can call this endpoint and instantly get contextual code data.

**Example Scenario**:
- You have an AI agent that audits developers’ repositories.
- Instead of giving it direct GitHub credentials & API logic, it just calls `http://mcp-server/github?user=developer` and gets all repos ready to analyze.
